## How `cz-emoji-conventional` looks

Here are some examples of git commit titles.

```md
- ‚ú® feat: add signup pages from (#11)
- üêõ fix(test): get browser width for android devices
- ‚ôªÔ∏è refactor(sc): refactor to styled component
- üß™ test: add test for splitmerge
```

Format is as below

```text
[emoji] [type]([scope]): [commit msg] (#[issue No.])
```
